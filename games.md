An implementation of the alpha release of minecraft. I implemented a voxel engine from scratch using C++ and OpenGL. Terrain, trees, and flowers are generated using a customized perlin noise function, chunks of voxels are streamed in so that the player can explore the world infinitely, and the player can add or remove voxels from the world.
